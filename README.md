# Task
The task is to create a model for recognizing Uzbek speech

# Description
You've probably heard about Siri, Bixby and Google-assistant, they all understand our speech and follow the commands we say. So this is how they understand what we want???

They have a model for human voice recognition; they are specially trained to understand our speech, but hereâ€™s the problem: we all speak different languages. In my case, I want to create a model for the Uzbek language that can understand our speech well.

The biggest problem for me was finding data in Uzbek with text. Well, for this I looked for all the information on the Internet and found several ways.

1 - is a video from YouTube.

2 - are open bases.

3 - record your voice yourself

I chose option 1 and 2
